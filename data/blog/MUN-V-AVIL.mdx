Manchester United kept the FA Cup run going as they defeated Aston Villa with an early goal from Scott Mctominay. This goal was decisive as the match ended with a 1-0 scoreline.

Here are the player ratings for the match:

David De Gea – 8/10
Did his job brilliantly and was at his toes to deny Matthew Cash’s effort. This kept United in the lead.

Diogo Dalot – 7.5/10
Showed promise and kept going on after the first-half injury. Improved his performance in the 2nd Half.

Victor Lindelof – 6/10
Mistakenly assisted Watkins’ chance at the 30th minute. However, steadied himself in the 2nd half.

Raphael Varane – 7.5/10
Cool, calm and composed on the ball. Put up a better performance than Victor Lindelof. Overall a classy performance.

Luke Shaw – 6/10
Composed in the 1st Half. Made a brilliant strike in the 37th minute Then got booked in the 68th minute after blocking Watkins’ run.

Fred – 7.5/10
Brilliant cross to McTominay and pressed actively. Overall energetic throughout the match.

Scott McTominay – 7/10
His goal was the match-winner as he scored the only goal of the game. Worked hard in the middle of the park to keep Villa at bay but lacked the requisite support.

Mason Greenwood – 5/10
Should really learn how to pass the ball to his teammates. Displayed some selfish tendencies and rarely had any of the back four on the back foot.

Bruno Fernandes – 5.5/10
Really not in his best form. However, made some clean passes and was creative with the ball. Rangnick needs to work to fit Bruno in his current system.

Marcus Rashford – 4.5/10
Really out of his form and struggling with the ball. Bad body language too. United should help him work on these problems.

Edinson Cavani – 6/10
Was played in by Bruno Fernandes but his shot was deflected. Lacked some consistency but a nice performance overall

Subs:
Donny Van De Beek : 6.5
Anthony Elanga : 6/10
Jesse Lingard : 5.5/10
